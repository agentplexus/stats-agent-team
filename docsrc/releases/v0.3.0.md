# Release Notes v0.3.0

**Release Date:** December 21, 2025

This release introduces major features for agent interoperability, observability, and security, along with performance improvements and comprehensive documentation updates.

## Highlights

- **A2A Protocol Support** - Full inter-agent protocol implementation for agent interoperability
- **LLM Observability** - MetaObserve integration for tracing and monitoring LLM operations
- **Security Documentation** - Comprehensive security guide for production deployments
- **Project Roadmap** - Published feature roadmap for Q1-Q3 2026

## New Features

### A2A Inter-Agent Protocol Support
Added support for Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol across all agents, enabling standardized inter-agent communication and interoperability:

- `agents/orchestration/a2a.go` - A2A server for ADK orchestration agent
- `agents/orchestration-eino/a2a.go` - A2A server for Eino orchestration agent
- `agents/research/a2a.go` - A2A server for research agent
- `agents/synthesis/a2a.go` - A2A server for synthesis agent
- `agents/verification/a2a.go` - A2A server for verification agent

Uses the `a2aproject/a2a-go` library with Google ADK's `adka2a` integration.

### LLM Observability via MetaObserve
Added integrated observability for LLM operations with support for multiple backends:

- **Opik** - Comet ML's LLM observability platform
- **Langfuse** - Open-source LLM observability
- **Phoenix** - Arize AI's open-source observability

Configuration via environment variables:
- `OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true`
- `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=opik|langfuse|phoenix`
- `OBSERVABILITY_PROJECT=your-project-name`

### LLM Adapter Refactoring
Replaced the gollm adapter with the new MetaLLM adapter (`pkg/llm/adapters/metallm_adapter.go`) for improved multi-LLM provider support with built-in observability hooks.

## Documentation

### Security Guide (`README_SECURITY.md`)
Comprehensive security documentation covering:
- Threat modeling for multi-agent systems
- Credential management best practices
- Cloud deployment security (AWS/Azure)
- SPIFFE/SPIRE workload identity
- Network and API security
- Container security hardening
- Incident response procedures
- Compliance considerations

### Project Roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`)
Published feature roadmap including:
- Q1 2026: Perplexity API, range statistics, response streaming
- Q2 2026: Multi-language support, caching layer, GraphQL API
- Q3 2026: Browser extension, Notion/Confluence integrations, citation formats

### Presentation Materials
Added `presentation.md` with comprehensive project overview for conferences and demos.

## Enhancements

- **Performance improvement** - Enhanced team stats finding via `make run-all-eino`
- **Updated README** - Revised architecture diagram and feature documentation
- **Interactive documentation** - Added `docs/index.html` for browsable documentation

## Dependencies

- Updated `github.com/cloudwego/eino` from 0.7.8 to 0.7.10
- Added `github.com/a2aproject/a2a-go` for A2A protocol support
- Added `github.com/grokify/metallm` for unified LLM interface
- Added `github.com/grokify/metaobserve` for observability integration
- Various go.mod dependency updates

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed various linting issues identified by golangci-lint

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Migration Guide

### Enabling Observability (Optional)

To enable LLM observability, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true
export OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=opik  # or langfuse, phoenix
export OBSERVABILITY_PROJECT=stats-agent
export OBSERVABILITY_API_KEY=your-api-key  # if required by provider
```

### A2A Protocol

A2A servers run alongside existing HTTP servers. No configuration changes required - A2A support is automatically available when agents start.
